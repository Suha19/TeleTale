# Work Steps

 - I’ve started to create the React front-end application for the MERN stack application. 
 - In this second part I’ve continued with building the back-end server based on Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
 - I’ve connected the Node.js / Express server to MongoDB by using the Mongoose library.
